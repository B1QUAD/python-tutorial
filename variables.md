# Variables

In Python variables can hold any type of value; it does not even have to be the same across a variable's lifetime.
Variables in Python do not need to be defined prior to being assigned to.

```python
foo = 'bar'
```

This snippet makes a new string variable with the value `'bar'`.

Just about anything in Python can be assigned to a variable and passed around as such.

```python
foo = print
foo('Hello world')
```

This program will print `Hello world` just as if the print function had been called directly.
