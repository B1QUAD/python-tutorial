# Your first program

The simplest Python program is just an empty text file.
Python doesn't require any special functions or objects to be created unlike C or Java.
The Python iterpreter will simply execute each line in the source file starting at the top.

As is tradition, your first Python program will simply print `Hello world`.

```python
print('Hello world')
```

Save this file as `hello.py` and run it on the command line with `python hello.py`.
If you installed Python correctly then you should see `Hello world` printed and be returned to your prompt.
