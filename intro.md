# Intro

This guide is written for an audience who is already familiar
with languages such as C and Java.

## Installing

Install the latest version of Python 3 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Be sure to install Python 3 and not Python 2.
Python 2 is deprecated and will not be maintained past January 1 2020.
No new code should be written in Python 2.

When installing be sure to add Python to the PATH so you can run scripts
from the command line.

Open up a command prompt and run `python` to ensure that Python is installed correctly.
You should be greeted with a welcome message which includes the version of Python running.
Ensure that this version number matches the one you installed.
Type `exit()` to leave the interactive prompt.

You can open an interactive prompt at any time to test out small snippets of code without having to make a new script.
